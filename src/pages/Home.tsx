            <p>🌟 I am a recent high school graduate who is always curious and learning. I love diving deep into everything I do, from learning languages, programming, and singing to swimming and doing martial arts.</p>
            <p>🌐 I am a highly motivated individual who seeks always to enrich myself. Despite not having taken computer science courses in high school, I am currently learning Java and web development with ReactJS and tailwindCSS by building and creating projects. </p>
            <p>✨ I am seeking to do work that is meaningful and impact to myself, my community, and the world. As a citizen of the world, I believe that I have the responsibility to do what I can to help others.</p>
